# Cocoa AI

Artificial Intelligence is eating the world! We all saw it coming, but were
waiting for the right moment to start building more intelligent apps.
Thanks to Apple we've got the opportunity to take advantage of new Natural
Language Processing API, CoreML and Vision frameworks
[introduced](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) at WWDC17 ðŸŽ‰

[Cocoa AI](https://github.com/cocoa-ai) is a place to play, experiment and
build working prototypes using machine learning, computer vision, natural
language processing and other subsets of artificial intelligence in Cocoa apps.

## Vision

application for age and gender classification of facial images.
- [FlowersVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/FlowersVisionDemo) - iOS11
demo application for flower classification.
- [InceptionVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/InceptionVisionDemo) - iOS11
demo application for dominant objects detection.
- [StylesVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/StylesVisionDemo) - iOS11 demo
application for image style classification.

## NLP

- [NamesCoreMLDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/NamesCoreMLDemo) - iOS11 demo 
application for predicting gender from first names.
- [SentimentCoreMLDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/SentimentCoreMLDemo) - iOS11
