# Cocoa AI

Artificial Intelligence is eating the world! We all saw it coming, but were
waiting for the right moment to start building more intelligent apps.
Thanks to Apple we've got the opportunity to take advantage of new Natural
Language Processing API, CoreML and Vision frameworks
[introduced](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) at WWDC17 ðŸŽ‰

[Cocoa AI](https://github.com/cocoa-ai) is a place to play, experiment and
build working prototypes using machine learning, computer vision, natural
language processing and other subsets of artificial intelligence in Cocoa apps.

## Vision
- [FacesVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/FacesVisionDemo) - age and 
gender classification of facial images.
- [FlowersVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/FlowersVisionDemo) - flower 
classification.
- [InceptionVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/InceptionVisionDemo) - dominant 
objects detection.
- [SentimentVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/SentimentVisionDemo) - visual 
sentiment prediction.
- [StylesVisionDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/StylesVisionDemo) - image style 
classification.

## NLP

- [NamesCoreMLDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/NamesCoreMLDemo) - predicting 
gender from first names.
- [SentimentCoreMLDemo](https://github.com/cocoa-ai/SentimentCoreMLDemo) - sentiment 
polarity analysis.
